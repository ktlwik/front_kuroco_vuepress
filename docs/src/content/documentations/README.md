> The official guide assumes intermediate level knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you are totally new to frontend development, it might not be the best idea to jump right into a framework as your first step - grasp the basics then come back! Prior experience with other frameworks helps, but is not required.

The easiest way to try out Kuroco is using the <span class="c-txt-attention">Hello World example</span>. Feel free to open it in another tab and follow along as we go through some basic examples. Or, you can <span class="c-txt-attention">create an <span class="c-txt-attention c-txt-attention--purple">index</span>.html file</span> and include Vue with:
```
<!-- development version, includes helpful console warnings -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js"></script>
```
or
```
<!-- production version, optimized for size and speed -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue"></script>
```
The Installation page provides more options of installing Kuroco. Note: We do not recommend that beginners start with kuroco-cli, especially if you are not yet familiar with Node.js-based build tools.

If you prefer something more interactive, you can also check out this tutorial series on Scrimba, which gives you a mix of screencast and code playground that you can pause and play around with anytime.
